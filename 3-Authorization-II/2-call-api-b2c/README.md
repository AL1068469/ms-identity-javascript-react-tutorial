## Overview

This sample demonstrates a React SPA calling a Node.js web API that is secured using Azure AD B2C.

## Scenario

1. The client React SPA uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD B2C**.
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the Node.js web API protected **Azure AD B2C**.

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

:warning: This sample comes with a pre-registered application for demo purposes. If you would like to use your own **Azure AD B2C** tenant and application, follow the steps below to register and configure the application on **Azure portal**. Otherwise, continue with the steps for [Running the sample](#running-the-sample).

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD B2C tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD B2C tenant.

### Create User Flows and Custom Policies

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Create user flows in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows)

### Add External Identity Providers

Please refer to: [Tutorial: Add identity providers to your applications in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-add-identity-providers)

### Register the service app (ms-identity-react-c3s2-api)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-react-c3s2-api`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`https://{tenantName}.onmicrosoft.com/{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-react-c3s2-api`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access ms-identity-react-c3s2-api as the signed-in user.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

#### Configure the service app (ms-identity-react-c3s2-api) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `API\config.json` file.
1. Find the key `clientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ms-identity-react-c3s2-api` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantID` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.

### Register the spa app (ms-identity-react-c3s2-spa)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-react-c3s2-spa`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any identity provider or organizational directory (for authenticating users with user flows)**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Single-page application** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
       - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
       - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
       - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
       - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
       - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
       - In the list of APIs, select the API `ms-identity-react-c3s2-api`.
       - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **Access 'ms-identity-react-c3s2-api'** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
       - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the spa app (ms-identity-react-c3s2-spa) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `SPA\src\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ms-identity-react-c3s2-spa` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Web_Api_Scope_Here` and replace the existing value with Scope.

## About the code

### Token Validation

[passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) validates the token against the `issuer`, `scope` and `audience` claims (defined in `BearerStrategy` constructor) using the `passport.authenticate()` API:

```javascript
    app.get('/api', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', { session: false }),
        (req, res) => {
            console.log('Validated claims: ', req.authInfo);
    );
```

On the web API side, [passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) validates the token against the `issuer`, `scope` and `audience` claims (defined in `BearerStrategy` constructor) using the `passport.authenticate()` API:

```javascript
    app.get('/api', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', { session: false }),
        (req, res) => {
            console.log('Validated claims: ', req.authInfo);
    );
```

Clients should treat access tokens as opaque strings, as the contents of the token are intended for the resource only (such as a web API or Microsoft Graph). For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode **JWT**s (*JSON Web Tokens*) using a site like [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms).

### CORS Settings

For the purpose of the sample, **cross-origin resource sharing** is enabled for **all** domains. This is insecure. In production, you should modify this as to allow only the domains that you designate.

```javascript
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
        next();
    });
```
